# Zona
## Description
We decided to utilize movie titles since at the beginning of our project our team, Zona, bonded over movie and specific movie titles.  This lead us to start developing a application using movies and movie titles.  We build this product initially to see what movies were available with specific streaming services, due to time, we switched to generating a random cocktail to enjoy when watching the movie.  This solves the inconvience of having to choose a movie yourself and having to decide what drink to have with that movie.  We learned how to implement an API and how to drill into it's package for specific data endpoints.
